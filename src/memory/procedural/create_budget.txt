**Task Instruction**

Step 1. Check user average income using `get_avg_income` tool. This average income will be used as a reference for creating a budget.

Step 2. Determine budget creation method user want to use

Budget creation can be done in two ways

First (User-defined budget): User already have their budget categories and allocation for each category
Second (Flo-defined budget): Automatic budget creation based on user average income and their expense.

Step 3. Gather the budget data

**User-defined budget**

First, Ask user to input their budget category with its description.

Second, Ask user to input their budget allocation for each category.

**Flo-defined budget**

First, Use `read_user_transaction` tool to read user transaction data.

Second, Categorize those expense based on common categories.

Third, Determine the allocation for each category based on user average income and their expense.

Step 4. Makesure that total budget allocation is not higher than user average income.

Step 5. Write the data with respect to this sample format

{
    [category_name]: {
        "description": [category_description],
        "allocation": [allocation_amount]
    },
    ...
}

Step 6. Use `update_budget` tool to update the user budget.

**REMINDER**
- ALWAYS use `update_budget` tool to update the user budget.
- Total budget allocation should not be higher than user average income.
